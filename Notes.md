Rimworld Mod Idea:
Core Concept:
- Main purpose is too alow pawns to help other pawns make food, craft and many other things, makeing things gofaster.
- when Waiting on one very importent things to lets say something like food, this will allows pawns to help each other make the cooking prosses go faster, For example, if everyone is starveing and you only have one cooking bench and you are waiting for the food to be butchered and cooked, instead of waiting for the one pawn to do all the working while the others are waiting, but instead the other 2 pawns can help, makeing the whole prossess go faster.

Mod Functionality:
1. **Helping Action**:
   - Add a "Help" button to the game interface.
   - Allows one pawn to assist another in specific tasks like crafting or cooking. 
   - Accessible through the right-click menu when one pawn is selected and another is performing a task.
**Helping Mechanics**:
   - Helper pawns contribute to the main worker's speed, with assistance proportional to their skill level.
   - Base contribution rate:
     - Each helper pawn contributes half of their skill-based work speed to the primary worker.
     - Example: A Level 10 helper would contribute at a rate of 5 (half of their standard work speed).
   - Helper Leveling:
     - Helpers can level up as they assist, allowing them to contribute more of their skill-based speed.
     - A Level 20 Helper can contribute 100% of their speed to the task, doubling the impact of a typical Level 10 helper.

**Quality Trade-Off**: 
   - To balance speed boosts, assisting will potentially lower the final quality of the item produced.
   - Quality reduction:
     - Each additional helper pawn reduces the max possible quality of the final product.
     - Concept: "Too many cooks" mechanic â€“ ensures over-reliance on multiple helpers won't yield high-quality items.
   - Examples:
     - If three pawns assist, the max quality may cap at "Good."
     - More than three pawns may lead to even lower quality, like "Poor," or penalties in food, potentially causing sickness.

Goals and Future Expansion(each of these steps should be exspsnaded on deaper, but this is an overview of each section. )
- On a Basic Lvl i want to implament the Helping button, whitch is when i selects one pawn and right click another pawn, there is a new button Called "Help" and for quick testing will only just output something simple into the log for example something like "Helped Pawn: Blank, Helper Pawn: Blank".
- Once the Help button is added and tested i want to Work on the basic form of the Helping job, At the Very least when the button is clicked the the Helper pawn will start to follow and stand next too the Helped pawn no matter where they are going and that when you look at your skills menue, there will be a Helper Job in there now.
- Once the Helper pawn Follows the Helped pawn, I want to work on the basic form of the helping machanic, and in this case we will start with Crafting(we can add more jobs late) and when the Helped Pawn is Working on crafting an item at a crafting spot(Eventually we will also add All the other workstations) that we will see that the helped pawn is useing the crafting skill and will add the Crafting speed of the Helper pawn to the Speed of the Helped pawn while the Helped pawn.(we will most likely have to use Harmony to do these interactions of helper useing help job interacting with the Helped pawn useing the crafting job)
- Once i see that the Helped crafting is faster with a helper pawn, allow for there to be multable helper pawns adding there crafting speed to make things go faster. starting to keep track of how many pawns are helping.
- Once i see that multable helper pawns can make the Helped pawns crafting go faster, i want to start to Make sure the helper pawns get exsperence in the skill of the Helped job(in this case Crafting skill) and the Helper skill.
- Now we want to Start to look at adding more interactions with diffrent jobs, Now we will start trying to make it easyer for us to see what job is being worked on and what skill needs to be used for this job and how much esperence needs to be given to the Helpers for those jobs.
