Here's an outline for the Helper mod based on your conversation:

### **Helper Mod Outline for RimWorld**

#### **Objective**
- Add a quality-of-life mechanic where one pawn can assist another in tasks such as crafting or cooking, enhancing work speed without breaking game balance.

#### **Core Mechanic**
1. **Helping Action**:
   - Add a "Help" button to the game interface.
   - When selected, allows one pawn to assist another in specific tasks like crafting or cooking.
   - Accessible through the right-click menu when one pawn is selected and another is performing a task.

2. **Helping Mechanics**:
   - Helper pawns contribute to the main worker's speed, with assistance proportional to their skill level.
   - Base contribution rate:
     - Each helper pawn contributes half of their skill-based work speed to the primary worker.
     - Example: A Level 10 helper would contribute at a rate of 5 (half of their standard work speed).
   - Helper Leveling:
     - Helpers can level up as they assist, allowing them to contribute more of their skill-based speed.
     - A Level 20 Helper can contribute 100% of their speed to the task, doubling the impact of a typical Level 10 helper.

3. **Quality Trade-Off**:
   - To balance speed boosts, assisting will potentially lower the final quality of the item produced.
   - Quality reduction:
     - Each additional helper pawn reduces the max possible quality of the final product.
     - Concept: "Too many cooks" mechanic â€“ ensures over-reliance on multiple helpers won't yield high-quality items.
   - Examples:
     - If three pawns assist, the max quality may cap at "Good."
     - More than three pawns may lead to even lower quality, like "Poor," or penalties in food, potentially causing sickness.

#### **Gameplay Flow**
1. **Initial Mod Setup**:
   - Introduce a basic "Help" button and functionality.
   - Test and debug core functionality to ensure pawns can correctly assist one another.

2. **Helper Mechanics Implementation**:
   - Configure how helpers calculate their speed boost and cap based on skill level.
   - Add skill-based progression for helpers to level up and contribute more effectively.

3. **Balancing and Quality Controls**:
   - Implement quality caps and debuffs based on helper count.
   - Add specific debuffs or drawbacks for certain tasks, like increased food sickness risk from too many cooks.

4. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Playtest various scenarios to fine-tune speed, leveling, and quality mechanics.
   - Ensure helper interactions feel balanced and satisfying, with clear benefits and trade-offs.

#### **Future Expansion Ideas** (optional)
- Introduce a specialized "Helper" job role, allowing players to designate pawns as helpers.
- Add additional skill-based benefits for certain tasks, such as faster learning speed for helpers who assist often in one skill area.
