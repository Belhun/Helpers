## **Terminology**

- **Leader (Pawn):** The pawn that is leading the tasks being done.
- **Assistant (Pawn):** A pawn who is helping the Leader (Pawn).
- **Support Team / Assistants (Pawns):** A group of pawns who are helping a Leader (Pawn).

---

## **Mod Concepts and Purpose**

This mod is centered around pawns helping other pawns in RimWorld. When a player selects a pawn and right-clicks another pawn, a new option **"Help {Pawn Name}"** appears. Selecting this option assigns the selected pawn (Assistant) to follow and assist the targeted pawn (Leader). While assisting, the Leader receives bonuses to various tasks, such as:

- **Cooking:** Increased cooking speed.
- **Mining:** Increased mining speed.
- **Crafting:** Increased crafting speed.

The idea originated from scenarios where a single pawn is overwhelmed with tasks (e.g., cooking for a starving colony) and others could logically help. Additionally, it's a way for pawns to learn skills by being mentored by the Leader.

---

## **Balance Mechanics**

To maintain game balance, the following systems are in place:

### **Quality Trade-Off System**

- When crafting or building, having more assistants can lead to a decrease in the maximum possible quality of the item.
- After 3 or 4 assistants (exact number to be decided), the maximum quality reduces to at most "Normal."
- The Leader's skill level still determines the base quality cap.
  - **Example:** If a Leader can craft items up to "Normal" quality, additional assistants won't increase this cap.

### **Helper Skill**

- A new skill called **"Helper"** limits how much a pawn can assist.
- At **Level 0 Helper Skill**: Assistants contribute 50% of their normal work speed to the Leader's task.
- At **Level 10 Helper Skill**: Assistants contribute 75% of their normal skill-related speed.
- At **Level 20 Helper Skill**: Assistants contribute 100% of their normal work speed.

### **Mood Buffs/Debuffs**

- **Traits and Relationships** affect mood buffs or debuffs for both Leaders and Assistants.
  - **Beautiful Assistant:** +5 mood buff to everyone, including the Leader.
  - **Ugly Assistant:** -5 mood debuff to everyone.
  - **Rivals:** -5 mood debuff for both pawns if they are rivals.
  - **Friends/Lovers:** +5 mood buff if they are friends or lovers.

### **Surgery System**

- Assistants can increase the success chance for surgeries if they are highly skilled (Level 10 or higher).
- Low-skill (Level 5 or below) assistants add failure risks.

---

## **Tasks That Can Be Assisted**

- **Construction:** Crafting furniture and building structures.
- **Crafting:** General crafting tasks, including cooking.
- **Plants:** Cutting, harvesting, and sowing.
- **Doctoring:** Bandaging, treating sickness, surgeries.
- **Mining**
- **Cooking**
- **Animal Handling:** Training (planned feature).

    - **Construction**
    - **Crafting** (including cooking and tasks through RimWorld's Bill system)
    - **Plant Cutting**
    - **Doctoring** (Performing surgeries, affecting speed and success chance)
  - **Helper Contribution Formula:**
    \[
    \text{Helper Contribution} = \left(0.5 + \frac{\text{Helper Skill Level}}{40}\right) \times \text{Helper Work Speed}
    \]
- **Settings Implemented:**
  - Option to allow assistants to contribute to unknown surgeries (with a warning to the player).
  - Debug information toggle for unknown surgeries to assist with development.

## **In Progress**

- **Helper Mining System:** Implementing assistants helping with mining tasks.

---

## **To-Do List**

### **High Priority**

- **Bug Fix:**
  - Resolve issue where assistants assigned to help a Leader are not correctly tracked after saving and reloading the game. Assistants continue to follow but are not in the tracking lists on the Leader pawn.

- **Complete Helper Mining System:**
  - Finalize the implementation of assistants helping with mining tasks.

### **Testing Needed**

- **Doctoring:**
  - Verify if Leaders can be assisted in bandaging and treating sick pawns (not just surgeries).
- **Plant Work:**
  - Test assisting in plant tasks like harvesting and sowing.
- **Building Repair:**
  - Check if assistants help with repairing structures.

### **Core Mechanics**

- **Assistant's Carrying Capacity and Speed:**
  - Implement assistants contributing their carrying capacity to the Leader.
  - Decide on whether assistants should affect the Leader's movement speed (possibly make it a setting).

- **UI Improvements:**
  - Develop a user interface for assigning and monitoring assistants.
  - Allow multiple pawns to be selected and assigned to a Leader simultaneously.
    - Possibly implement a "Helper" button that functions like the attack command but assigns pawns as assistants.

- **Leader Downed Reaction System:**
  - Create a system where assistants react when a Leader is downed or has a mental break.
  - Reactions could include disbanding, drafting, or rescuing the Leader.
  - Allow for individual assistant responses based on settings or pawn traits.

- **Surgery Contribution Limitations:**
  - Re-evaluate the current limitations on surgery assistance.
  - Adjust values or mechanics to improve gameplay balance.

- **Helper Social Mechanics Enhancements:**
  - **Divorced Relationship:** Add mood debuff.
  - Incorporate more traits and relationships affecting mood buffs/debuffs.

- **Debugging System Settings:**
  - Add settings to control specific debugging classes.
  - Include an overall toggle for the debugging system.

- **Crafting/Building Quality Trade-Off System:**
  - Implement the system where additional assistants can reduce the maximum quality of crafted items after a certain number of helpers.

### **Additional Features**

- **Animal Handling:**
  - Implement assistance in animal training tasks.

- **Bulk Assignment:**
  - Allow assigning multiple assistants to a Leader at once.

- **Workshop Preparation:**
  - Create a workshop photo and description for the mod.

---

## **Possible Features to Verify**

- **Doctoring (Bandaging/Treating Sickness):**
  - Confirm if this feature has been implemented or needs development.

- **Plant Work (Harvesting/Sowing):**
  - Verify the status of this feature.

- **Building Repair Assistance:**
  - Determine if assistants currently help with repairs.

---

## **Notes on User Interaction and Selection Mechanics**

- Consider improving object selection when multiple entities occupy the same tile.
  - When the user hovers over an option in the menu, highlight the corresponding object in-game.
  - This "hover-selecting" aids in confirming the correct selection, similar to normal item selection in RimWorld.

---

## **Debugging and Development Tools**

- **Debug System:**
  - Commands for controlled debugging.
  - Ability to enable or disable debugging messages globally or per class.

---

## **Style and Tone Considerations**

- The mod aims for an informal, conversational tone that matches the user's writing style.
- Ensure proper spelling in all communications and in-game texts.
- Maintain consistency with the game's existing user interface and player experience.

---

## **Additional Notes**

- **Writing Style Example:**

  > "Okay, well, let's go back to the very beginning and talk a little bit more and kind of explore and maybe add stuff to the mod. Okay, so I have an idea of how we select a pawn or object. So, something I realized when it comes to RimWorld is that when you right-click anywhere or left-click, there are usually more than one thing in that square, either that is like a plant and a pawn, or it could be plenty of other things. Also, I probably would want to also keep in mind all the objects that are there and then ask the user, which object would you like to use? If they hover over a particular object that's in the menu where they get to choose, then the actual object itself in-game will also have a square pop up around it. Similar to when you normally select an item, this would just kind of be like a way of kind of hover-selecting and kind of acknowledging what you're going to select."
